# Diabates-Prediction-with-ML

Business Problem

Can you develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified?

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. Persons aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women.
